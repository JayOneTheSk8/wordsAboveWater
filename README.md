# Words Above Water

## How to Play:
Welcome to Words Above Water where spelling couldn't be much harder! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to spell all the words within the given set of letters while avoiding the impending tide from coming in and covering the letters available to you. Any word spelled (over 3 characters) garners you points based on the letters used and the length of the word.
The game is over if you fall into the water, only have vowels available to you, or spell all of the words within your given set of letters (excluding the ones covered up by the tide).

## How to Spell a Word:
Jumping on the blocks available to you start your word creation. Only consonants are available to you to jump on, and if you would like to use a vowel, you must jump to the top to retrieve them by hitting the blocks.
No matter what word you are trying to spell, the blocks will add on to your fragment and will only reset once you try to submit it. If you spell a word incorrectly your best bet is to submit it as fast as possible to reset your fragment!
